# The Tower of Hanoi

The [Tower of Hanoi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_of_Hanoi) is a classic mathematical puzzle that consists of three rods and a number of disks of different sizes. The goal of the game is to move the entire stack of disks from one rod to another rod, subject to the rule that no disk may be placed on top of a smaller disk.

## Features

This web app allows the user to play the Tower of Hanoi game. It includes the following features:

- Responsive user interface
- Dark mode (planned)
- Game hints (planned)

## Stack

This project is built using the following technologies:

- [React.js](https://reactjs.org/) for building the user interface
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) for type checking and improved developer experience
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for styling
- [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) for unit testing

## Running the app

1. Install the required dependencies:

    ```shell
    npm install
    ```

2. Start the development server:

    ```shell
    npm start
    ```

    This runs the app in the development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

    The page will reload if you make edits. You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### Testing the app

To run the tests, use the following command:

```shell
npm test
```

### Building the app

To create a production build of the app, use the following command:

```shell
npm run build
```

This will create a optimized build of the app in the build directory. You can then deploy this build to a web server or hosting service.

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes. You can then deploy this build to a web server or hosting service.
